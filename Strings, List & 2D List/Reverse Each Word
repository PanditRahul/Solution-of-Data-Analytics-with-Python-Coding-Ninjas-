Solution



from sys import stdin


def reverseEachWord(string) :
	# Your code goes here

    arr = string.split(' ')
    ans = ''
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        arr[i] = arr[i][::-1] + ' '
        ans += arr[i]
    return ans




#main
string = stdin.readline().strip()

ans = reverseEachWord(string)

print(ans)
