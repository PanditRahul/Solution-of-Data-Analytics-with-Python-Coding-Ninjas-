Output Format :
Required Sum 
Sample Input 1 :
 6
 
 Solution
 
 '''
	Pre-requisite to solve this problem:
	In this question, we have to find sum of all even numbers till n. To take sum of all the even numbers, we have to take a variable and initialize it to zero. Let us name this variable as sum. 
	Following code is used to add 2 to sum variable and update it to the same sum variable:
	sum = sum + 2 
	
	Hint to solve this problem: We will have to loop on even numbers only and add the even numbers to the same sum variable, described above.

## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
n = int(input())
sum = 0
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    if(i % 2 == 0):
        sum = sum+i
print(sum)
