You are given n triangles. You are required to find how many triangles are unique out of given triangles. For each triangle you are given three integers a, b and c (the sides of a triangle).
A triangle is said to be unique if there is no other triangle with same set of sides.
In other words, we have to find frequency of each triangle and return the count of triangles whose frequency is 1.
Note : It is always possible to form triangle with given sides.
Input Constraints :
Line 1 : Integer n, the number of triangles
Next n lines : Three integers a,b,c (sides of a triangle).
Output Format :
print single integer, the number of unique triangles.
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^4
1 <= a,b,c <= 10^15.
Sample Input :
5
7 6 5
5 7 6
8 2 9
2 3 4
2 4 3
Sample Output :
1
Explanation:
The answer will be 1, as there is only one triangle with unique set of sides. There are three triangles here: Triangle with sides 2, 3, 4 and Triangle with sides 5, 6, 7 and Triangle with sides 2, 8, 9. The frequency of first two triangles is 2 and the frequency of last triangle is 1. Hence, there is only one triangle with frequency equal to 1.
