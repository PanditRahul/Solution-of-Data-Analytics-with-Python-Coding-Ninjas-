With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i x i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}




Solution

# Read input as sepcified in the question
# Print output as specified in the question
def squares(n):
    d = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        d[i] = i * i
    return d


n = int(input())
print(squares(n))
