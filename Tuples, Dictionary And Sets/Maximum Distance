Given an array that might contain duplicate elements, find the maximum possible distance between occurrences of two repeating elements i.e. elements having the same value. If there are no duplicate elements in the array, return 0.
Input Format :
Line 1: Contains integer N, which is the size of the array
Line 2: Contains N Integers, i.e. the elements of the array.
Sample Output :
 Line 1: Maximum Distance Value
Sample Input :
9
1  3  1  4  5  6  4  8  3
Sample Output :
7
Sample Output Explanation :
arr = [1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 4, 8, 3];
    index0 = 1
    index1 = 3
    index2 = 1
    index3 = 4
    index4 = 5
    index5 = 6
    index6 = 4
    index7 = 8
    index8 = 3

    In the above array, the repeating elements are :- (1, 3, 4)
    - Distance bw first and last occurence of 1 = 2(index2 - index0)
    - Distance bw first and last occurence of 3 = 7(index8 - index1)
    - Distance bw first and last occurence of 4 = 3(index6 - index3)

    So, for the above array you must return 7, as this is maximum possible distance between two repeating elements having same value.
    
    
    
    Solution
    
    
    # Read input as sepcified in the question
# Print output as specified in the question
n=int(input())

arr = list(map(int,input().split())) 

dist_mat = {}
max_dist = 0

for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] in dist_mat:
        max_dist = max(max_dist, i - dist_mat[arr[i]])
    else:
        dist_mat[arr[i]] = i

print(max_dist)
