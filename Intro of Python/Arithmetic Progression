You are given first three entries of an arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the common difference and print it.
Input format:
The first line of input contains an integer a (1 <= a <= 100)
The second line of input contains an integer b (1 <= b <= 100) 
The third line of input contains an integer c (1 <= c <= 100) 
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 second
Output format:
The first and only line of output contains the result.  
Sample Input:
1
3
5
Sample Output:
2


Solution:



# Write your code here

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
ans=b-a
print(ans)
